- *scss:* The main style language in this project
- *mui:* A  Library which gives us access (in this project) to pre made components.
- *flag-icons:* A library of flags of different countries.
- *i18next:* A library which allows an easy way of translating your app to different languages.
- *axios:*  A promise based HTTP Client for nodejs and the browser(A definition from axios docs).
